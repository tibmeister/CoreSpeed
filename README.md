CoreSpeed is an implementation of SpeedTest.Net using .Net Standard (Core).  

Currently the only CLI cross-platform solution is a Python script, so I wanted to build a robust compiled solution that can run cross-platform and independent of having to have Python and it's various modules installed.

CoreSpeed
=========

CoreSpeed is an implementation of SpeedTest.Net using .Net Standard.  Included is a test client for both .NET Core (ConsoleClient) and a UWP console app (UWPConsoleClient) for testing.  

Currently the only CLI cross-platform solution is a Python script, so I wanted to build a robust compiled solution that can run cross-platform and independent of having to have Python and it's various modules installed.
